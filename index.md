# [Pentesting Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ABmMokKL_AiCh6CGznK663EJDEh7kppu/view?usp=sharing)

This penetration testing report details the security assessment conducted on megacorpone, identifying vulnerabilities that 
could be exploited by attackers. The engagement included reconnaissance, exploitation, and post-exploitation analysis, 
revealing critical, high, and medium-risk vulnerabilities. Recommendations for remediation were provided to enhance security
posture and mitigate potential threats."

# [Splunk Log Analysis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dKfPR4RsnlaR86V7QtOpbWqBXdIit0t5/view?usp=sharing)

In this Splunk analysis, I established system baselines and monitored attack logs to detect anomalies and potential threats. 
By correlating log data from various sources, I identified deviations from normal behavior, uncovering indicators of 
compromise (IOCs) related to Brute Force attack, DDOS attack, and domain policy changes. The insights gained were used to 
enhance threat detection and improve incident response strategies.

# [MrRobot CTF Walkthorugh](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VfwPWVlOGWI69MmZcE1jEXkZTCCd7_ex/view?usp=sharing)

In this Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge inspired by MrRobot I exploited vulnerabilities using enumeration, web server 
misconfigurations, brute force attacks, wordpress vulnerabilities, and priviledge escalation. The walkthrough details each
step, including reconnaissance, exploitation, and flag retrieval, demonstrating my proficiency in ethical hacking and 
penetration testing methodologies.

# [Windows Active Directory](./windowsad.md)

In this activity, I configured and managed Group Policy Objects (GPOs) within a Windows Active Directory environment to 
enforce security policies and system configurations. I implemented restrictions, automated administrative tasks, and ensured 
compliance with organizational security standards. This exercise demonstrated my ability to strengthen enterprise security 
through centralized policy management.

# [HoneyPot in Linode](./honeypot.md)

I deployed a T-Pot honeypot on Linode to capture and analyze real-world cyber threats in a controlled environment. The setup 
included multiple honeypot services to detect various attack vectors, providing valuable insights into malicious activity, attacker 
behavior, and exploit techniques. Logs and analytics were used to enhance threat intelligence and improve defensive security strategies.
