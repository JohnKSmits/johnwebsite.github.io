# [Pentesting Report](./Pentest.md)

This penetration testing report details the security assessment conducted on megacorpone, identifying vulnerabilities that 
could be exploited by attackers. The engagement included reconnaissance, exploitation, and post-exploitation analysis, 
revealing critical, high, and medium-risk vulnerabilities. Recommendations for remediation were provided to enhance security
posture and mitigate potential threats."

# [Splunk](./Splunk.md)

In this Splunk analysis, I established system baselines and monitored attack logs to detect anomalies and potential threats. 
By correlating log data from various sources, I identified deviations from normal behavior, uncovering indicators of 
compromise (IOCs) related to Brute Force attack, DDOS attack, and domain policy changes. The insights gained were used to 
enhance threat detection and improve incident response strategies.



# [MrRobot CTF Walkthorugh](./mrrobot.md)

In this Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge inspired by MrRobot I exploited vulnerabilities using enumeration, web server 
misconfigurations, brute force attacks, wordpress vulnerabilities, and priviledge escalation. The walkthrough details each
step, including reconnaissance, exploitation, and flag retrieval, demonstrating my proficiency in ethical hacking and 
penetration testing methodologies.
